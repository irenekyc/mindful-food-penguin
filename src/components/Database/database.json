This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age. Showing super lush now.",

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is The Prisoner Wine Company The Snitch Chardonnay. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 32 dollars.",

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.",

Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try La Fiera Pinot Grigio.

Styled to be fuller in body and structure than most of Jadots M√¢connais wines, it is partially fermented and aged in oak casks to add breadth to the ripe fruit notes. The lovely, elegant Chardonnay nose, offset by a gentle touch of vanilla, carries into excellent balance of medium-full fruit and acidity on the palate and a lingering finish.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio.

Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.",

Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age. Showing super lush now.",
